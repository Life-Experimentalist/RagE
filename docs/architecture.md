# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the architecture of the FastAPI application integrated with the Agentic framework. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the design decisions made during the development of the project.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several main directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **app**: Contains the core application code, including API endpoints, models, schemas, services, and utility functions.
- **agentic**: Houses the Agentic framework components, including agents, prompts, and tools that enhance the application's capabilities.
- **addons**: Contains optional plugins that can extend the functionality of the application.
- **tests**: Includes unit tests for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application.
- **docs**: Contains documentation files for the project, including getting started guides and API references.

## Key Components

### FastAPI Application
The FastAPI application is the backbone of the project, providing a robust framework for building APIs. It is initialized in `app/main.py`, where middleware is set up, and the API router is mounted.

### API Endpoints
The API endpoints are defined in `app/api/endpoints/router.py`, where routes are connected to their respective handler functions. This modular approach allows for easy addition and management of endpoints.

### Models and Schemas
Data models are defined in `app/models/models.py`, while request and response validation schemas are created in `app/schemas/schemas.py`. This separation ensures a clear distinction between data representation and validation logic.

### Services
Business logic is encapsulated in the service layer located in `app/services/services.py`. This promotes reusability and maintainability of the code.

### Agentic Framework
The Agentic framework is integrated into the application to provide advanced functionalities through agents. The agents are defined in `agentic/agents.py`, and they utilize predefined prompts from `agentic/prompts.py` and tools from `agentic/tools.py`.

### Add-ons
Optional add-ons can be implemented in the `addons/plugins.py` file, allowing for extended functionalities without modifying the core application.

## Design Decisions
- **Modularity**: The application is designed in a modular fashion, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability. Each component has a clear responsibility, making it easier to manage and extend.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating models, schemas, services, and endpoints, the application adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, which enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **Integration with Agentic**: The decision to integrate the Agentic framework allows the application to leverage advanced capabilities, making it more powerful and flexible.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable and maintainable FastAPI application. The integration of the Agentic framework enhances its capabilities, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
